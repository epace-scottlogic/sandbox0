The server is built with flexibility in mind, enabling easy changes and additions of new data sources through a loosely-coupled, extensible codebase. The backend follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns across layers. Data flows from external WebSocket APIs through the application and out to consumers via REST API and SignalR for real-time updates.",
